Pickled
=======

Pickled is a linux distribution/image for Raspberry Pi, built on top of Raspbian.

At boot, Pickled will:

1. Start any Node.js application that is on your USB stick.
2. Start Iceweasel (basically identical to Firefox) in fullscreen, kiosk mode style.
3. Direct Iceweasel to http://127.0.0.1/ (that is your Node.js app).
 
More features:
* Pickled mounts your SD card and your USB stick as read-only, so the Raspberry can be unplugged without a proper shutdown.
* Put Iceweasel/Firefox extensions on your USB stick, and those will be auto installed before Iceweasel starts.


Download image file

* Was forked from [Pindestino version 2](https://github.com/klandestino/pindestino)



Write image to SD card
----------------------

First uncompress the downloaded .tar.gz file

	# tar xzvf pickled.img.tar.gz

Then write the image to a SD card. Check any Raspberry Pi tutorial for your OS.

In the Linux world, we do something like this: (Make sure /dev/mmcblk0 is the correct device!)

	# sudo dd bs=4M if=pickled.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
	# sudo sync


Build image
-----------

make must run as root, since the build will loopback mount the image:

	# sudo make


Booting image in qemu
---------------------

	# qemu-system-arm -kernel kernel-qemu -cpu arm1176 -m 256 -M versatilepb -no-reboot -serial stdio -append "root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 ro" -drive file=pickled.img,index=1,readonly,media=disk


Prepare your USB stick
----------------------

At boot, Pickled will search for a USB device with the files app/package.json and app/pickled.conf. Both those files must exist. It will then change directory (cd) into the app directory, and execute npm start.

Any node js application depenencies must be in the app/node_modules directory. NOTE: Binary modules must be of the Raspberry Pi architecture.

Your node.js application must listen at port 80. Otherwise, X11 and Iceweasel will not start.

You can put Firefox/Iceweasel extensions on your USB stick, and those will be installed before Iceweasel starts. Just create a directory called app/xpi on the USB stick, and put your .xpi file(s) there.


app/pickled.conf
-------------------

The app/pickled.conf should be on your USB stick, and it will set some configuration for your Pickled. It should be in YAML format. It could also be completely empty, however the file must exist.

To enable Wifi and set network name and password:

	wifi:
		network: MYWIFI
		password: secret

To mount your USB stick in read-write mode:

	usb: rw

To run a bootscript (before "npm start"). Note that it is relative to the USB stick's app directory. 

	bootscript: ./autostart.sh

To disable kiosk mode (full screen browser):

	kiosk: false

Don't start the browser (nor X11) at boot:

	browser: false

Don't start the node.js app at boot - just a browser:

	nodeapp: false


How to build your binary npm dependencies using Pickled 
----------------------------------------------------------

Your app directory on your USB stick need all npm dependencies installed before booting. Binary dependencies must be compiled for the Raspberry Pi architecture. This is how you could do that:

1. Put your node app on the USB stick and define all your dependencies in package.json.
2. Add "usb: rw" in your app/pickled.conf to make the USB stick writable.
3. Create a app/install.sh file on your USB stick, and paste this into it: rm -Rf node_modules; HOME="$(pwd)" NODE_JS_HOME="/opt/nodejs" PATH="$PATH:$NODE_JS_HOME/bin" npm install; sync
4. Add "bootscript: ./install.sh" to your app/pickled.conf, to run that bash script before Pickled runs "npm start".
5. Now boot Pickled on this USB stick. It will install your dependencies and compile your binary dependencien to the Raspberry Pi architecture.
6. Now your dependencies are on the USB stick. You can now remove "usb: rw" and "bootscript: ./install.sh" from your app/pickled.conf and delete the app/install.sh file.
7. Viola!

Note: Since the bootscript script will run before your network config is parsed from pickled.conf, the script must configure it's own network to have internet access. In the above example, we are using dhcp on eth0...

Also note: Some modules require symlinks to work on your USB stick. The FAT file system does not support symlinks, so you might have to format your USB stick to some linux filesystem, for example ext3. (You could use the HFS/HFS+ Mac OS X filesystem, however you must disable journaling on your USB stick, since we can not mount journaled HFS in read-write mode.)


Q & A
------

### Which Raspberries are supported?

Pinedstino has been tested on:

* Raspberry Pi Model B (the one with 2 USBs, 1 ethernet and 512 mb RAM).
* Raspberry Pi Model B+ (the one with 4 USBs, 1 ethernet and 512 mb RAM).
* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (the one with 4 USBs, 1 ethernet, 1 gb RAM and 4 cores).

### Where is some debug info / boot messages?

Press ctrl+alt+f2 for tty2, where that stuff is.

### What is the username and password?

Username is "pi". Password is "raspberry".

### How do I get cable ethernet connection?

Remove the "wifi" section from your app/pickled.conf on the USB stick, and reboot. Then Pickled will try to DHCP over the cable (eth0).

### Why is everything so slow?

Because Raspberry Pi is a slow computer.

### How long does it take to start up Pickled?

Depends a bit on your site, SD card performance, and more, but about 2 minutes and 30 seconds is probably normal duration from power on until the web app loaded in Iceweasel.

### Are you overclocking?

Yes, a very slight overclocking.

### Is it built on top of soft-float or hard-float Raspbian?

Hard-float.

### How do I change the resolution?

We hardcoded 720p into Pickled. In the future, we would like the resolution to be configurable in the USB stick's app/pickled.conf. However, you can change it, editing the config.txt on the SD card. See any Raspbian tutorial for more info.

### What is the license?

* GPLv3 for the buildscripts.
* The R-Kiosk Iceweasel/Firefox extension has it's own license.


TODO for future releases
-------------------------

* Screen resolution should be configurable in the USB stick's app/pickled.conf.
* Tor support (anonymous internet access).
* More networking config (like static IPs, routing yada yada, etc).
* Start a default node.js server with documentation if no USB stick is found within XX seconds.
* Support for open/non-wpa2 wifi networks.
